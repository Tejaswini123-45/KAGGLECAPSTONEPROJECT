## 🔒 Security Tips

1. **Use a Strong Password**: Make sure your Instagram account has a strong password
2. **Enable 2FA**: Turn on two-factor authentication in Instagram settings
3. **Consider a Separate Account**: Create a dedicated Instagram account for automation
4. **Keep .env Private**: Never commit your .env file to git (it's already in .gitignore)

## 📝 How It Works

This uses **Instagrapi**, a Python library that works with regular Instagram accounts:
- ✅ No Facebook account required
- ✅ No business account conversion needed
- ✅ Just your regular Instagram username/password
- ✅ Completely free
- ⚠️ Uses unofficial Instagram API (works great but not officially supported by Instagram)
